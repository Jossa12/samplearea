# samplearea
Python script for finding area of white sample on black background (with noise)

Hi everyone, so for my project I am photographing samples of which I then need to measure the area. The images are on a black background of a white sample (with some gradient in them) and some smaller reflextions from surrounding water. I was thinking something along the lines of the code below but this does not seem to work and I am kinda stuck on why. Bc of large quantity of pictures I thought a script would be useful. The images are in TIFF format.
